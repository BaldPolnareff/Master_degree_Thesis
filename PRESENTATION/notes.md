# Presentation Notes

I'll list all the notes I have for the presentation here. 

## Software to use

I have various options available to me for the presentation. I'll list them here and evaluate their pros and cons. 

This might seem like a waste of time at first, where I could jump istinctively to the first option that comes to mind, since I have the skills to use any of them creatively. 

However, I have a week left approximately, so I need to make sure I'm not wasting time on the wrong option. This will also serve to 
reorder my thoughts and restart with a fresh mind, after a long 
deterioration of my mental state.

+ **PowerPoint** or equivalents  - I can't wrap my head around its entire paradigm and it's mediocre at best. Hard pass for sure. 
+ **Latex Beamer** - First time I use Beamer, although at this point I'm pretty familiar with Latex. I can use it to create a presentation that looks good and is easy to edit. 

    In order to make it look good I'd have to find a pretty good    template, as there's no time to create one from scratch, although I do have a great skillset to do so myself. 

    Time is limited however and I can't use my talent with that, I need to save energy for my mental state. 

    Assuming I find a good template, I can use it to create a good looking presentation and the great advantage is I can easily edit it with my Latex skills, with a very non-destructing workflow.

+ **Canva** - This is a very easy to use software but it has disadvantages. It's not free, it's not open source and it's not very customizable. 

    I can use it to create a presentation that looks good and is easy to edit. 

    This will probably give the most aesthetically pleasing result, but its lack of flexibility can hinder me in the long run. There's intrinsic limitations to the setup in the presentation room, so I can't use it to its full potential and can't probably take advantage of the animations, assuming I have no way to use the presentation offline in its native format. 

    What I need to check is whether I have these exporting options: 

    + **PDF** - I can use it to create a static presentation that is portable and readable anywhere. Being static, this would be a waste for Canva itself. I would still make a static PDF as a backup though, regardless. 
    + **SVG** - I can make the presentation in the most flexible format possible and then further edit it in other software, like Inkscape. Time is limited though and I'm not sure it's worth the effort. 
    + **HTML** - I can use it to create a presentation that is portable and readable anywhere. Any modern browser can read it, so I can use it to present the presentation, even offline and take advantage of the animations. This would be the best option, assuming Canva can exporet to HTML. I would still make a backup PDF, regardless. 

+ **Inkscape** - This is my go to vector editing software, however I would need to plan everything from scratch and it's not particularly flexible with PDFs, although now it supports multipage documents. This would be very powerful in conjunction with *Sozi*, in order to get an offline HTML presentation. Way too time consuming, unfortunately. 
+ **Sozi** - This could be the ultimate weapon at my disposal, assuming I have an SVG template to start from (might be from Inkscape or Canva), I would just export an offline readable HTML file that I could open in any browser. Used in conjunction with Inkscape's power and flexibility, I could make a free canvas presentation, which is way more pleasing and fresh compared to the usual page by page layout. Again, this would probably take way too long, despite being the best option. 

# Presentation structure 

At the moment, my best choice is either going to be Latex Beamer or Canva. Either choice should give my a standard page by page presentation, which is the most common and easy to follow. Assuming I go for either of these, the overall document structure should be mostly the same. 

As far as the page layout goes, I could choose a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is Beamer's default and the one I tend to like the most, due to the extra vertical space. 

However, as the presentation is very likely to be projected on a 16:9 screen, I should probably use that aspect ratio, in order to fully utilize the screen real estate. 

As far as the content goes, I need to make sure I have a good structure, in order to make the presentation flow smoothly and that I stay within the imposed time limit of 15 minutes. 

My best choice is to utilize a very simple and visually effective structure, which gives me the most flexibility when speaking and allows me to improvise or cut down on the content, if time is running out. 

I'll try to organize it point by point. 

## Introduction 

+ **Title** - I should probably use the title of the presentation, which is *Preparation of bio-based powder for 3D
printing applications by Selective Laser
Sintering*.

+ **Thesis goal** - I should quickly state the goal of my thesis, probably in a single sentence that is straight to the point. A bit harder to summarize, but a simple slogan should be enough, allowing me to elaborate on it for a couple of minutes, if necessary.  

+ **Thesis work structure** - I should emphasize in the most brief and effective way possible how MY work has been structured throughout the months of torture, i.e. 

    + **Research** - I should quickly state the research I've done, in order to get a better understanding of the topic and the tools I had at my disposal 
    + **Experimental phase** - I should touch on the various phases, which I'll discuss in more detail later on, i.e. : 
        + **Powder production**  
        + **Powder characterization** 
        + **3D printing** 
        + **Results**
